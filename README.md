# UK-daily-climate-record

*This repository was taken from an assignment I did on Coursera.org platform:  
Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python*

**Project aim:**  
* Read the documentation and familiarize with the dataset, then write python code which returns a line
graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between
the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded.
* Overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record
high or record low was broken in 2015.
* Watch out for leap days (i.e. February 29th), it is reasonable to remove these points from the dataset for
the purpose of this visualization.
* Make the visual nice! Consider issues such as legends, labels, and chart junk.
